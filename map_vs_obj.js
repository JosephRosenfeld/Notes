//Maps are similar to objects in javascript
//Except for some key differences.

//Maps have no default keys whereas an Object has a prototype so
//it contains default keys

//A map can have any value for its keys (functions, objs, primitives)
//Objects must have either a string or a symbol for its keys

//Map keys are ordered in order of insertion whereas Object keys have
//a weird order (they used to not be ordered but are now)
//
//The size is easily retrievable on a Map object with the size property
//
